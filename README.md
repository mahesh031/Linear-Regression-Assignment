# Project Name
Linear Regression Assignment


## General Information
Model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 


## Conclusions
Train dataset R^2 : 0.836<br />
Test dataset R^2 : 0.7965<br />
Train dataset Adjusted R^2 : 0.833<br />
Test dataset Adjusted R^2 : 0.7868<br />

Overall we have a decent model, but we also acknowledge that we could do better.
